# PS5 Pre-order Tracker

This app was created for personal use in September 2020, during the Playstation 5 preorder drought.  The goal of it was to continuously search the inventories of major retailers to check if the PS5 was available for preorder, and if so, notifies the user so he or she can place the order immediately. It may not work correctly after the PS5's official release date, but could easily be forked to keep tabs on any other product launch.
